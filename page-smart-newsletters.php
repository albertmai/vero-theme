      <p>
        Instead of sending the same email to your entire list, Vero's behavioral tracking and dynamic segmentation make it easy to send personalized newsletters and promotional emails.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can even automate emails based on purchases or activity in your app. For example, automate a reminder to buy more dog food based on the purchase data and size of the previous order. Or trigger a retention email to users who haven't paid this month but haven't logged in for 14 days.

      <p>
        Not all of your contacts live on different time zones, making it hard to send email everyone at 7am on Tuesday.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vero's newsletters solve this problem by automatically tracking the location of each individual contact and allowing you to send emails based on each individual recipients' time zone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Increase your conversions by targeting people at the right time in their lives.

      <p>Want to target the most up to date list of customers that have <em>Checked out</em> three times before? Or your SaaS users that have signed up but not used a certain feature? Easy, with Vero's segment builder.</p>
