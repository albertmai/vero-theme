      <p>
        Instead of sending the same email to your entire list, Vero's behavioral tracking and dynamic segmentation make it easy to send personalized newsletters and promotional emails.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can even automate emails based on purchases or activity in your app. For example, automate a reminder to buy more dog food based on the purchase data and size of the previous order. Or trigger a retention email to users who haven't paid this month but haven't logged in for 14 days.

      <p>
        Your have contacts in different time zones, making it hard to send email everyone at 7am on Tuesday. Vero's time zone tool solves the problem by tracking location and allowing you to send emails based on individual recipients' time zone.

        Instead of downloading lists, organized them in Excel and uploading them every time you want to segment, let Vero automate it. Our dynamic segments update as your contacts take certain actions or you manually apply tags. Every segment is always up-to-date.
